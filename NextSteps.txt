To get this app running on your phone and eventually into the Play Store, here is the roadmap and the updated code with the "Build & Deploy" guide included in the settings.
How to Run and Test on Your Phone
Immediate Browser Testing (PWA):
The easiest way to test is to host the files (e.g., via Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages).
Open the link in Chrome on your Android phone.
Tap the three dots and select "Add to Home Screen."
Note: In browser mode, the "Accessibility Service" is simulated. To detect other apps (like Instagram) opening automatically, you need the Native Bridge.
Native Android Wrapper (Capacitor):
To make it a "real" app that can draw over other apps, use Capacitor.
Install Node.js on your computer, create a React project, and add Capacitor: npx cap add android.
Copy these files into the src folder.
The Native Part: Your technical plan mentions an Accessibility Service. You will need to add a small Kotlin file to the android/ folder that detects when a specific package (like com.instagram.android) comes to the foreground. When it does, it tells your React code to show the GlobalOverlay.
Publishing to Play Store:
Create a Google Play Console account ($25).
Use Android Studio to generate a "Signed Bundle" (AAB).
Upload to the Console. Tip: Since this uses Accessibility Services, Google will ask for a video showing how you use the permission. You must clearly state: "We use Accessibility Services to help users manage their screen time by detecting when monitored apps are opened."
